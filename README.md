# Coursera Project

I have built this project through Coursera Frontend Development with React course. I use JavaScript ES6 for developing the application. Core consepts and learning experience could be piled up as follows:

- Be familiar with client-side Javascript application development and the React library
- Be able to implement single page applications in React
- Be able to use various React features including components and forms
- Be able to implement a functional front-end web application using React
- Be able to use Reactstrap for designing responsive React applications
- Be able to use Redux to design the architecture for a React-Redux application

To run the project properly, follow the steps below:

-Initialize the project by `yarn start`
-Create a folder and install `json-server` on your computer by running ` npm install -g json-server` command
-Run `json-server --watch db.json -d 2000 -p 3001` command to start json-server
-Copy db.json file that is on your root folder of the project to your json-server folder
